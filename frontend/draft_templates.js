I, ${d.accused_name}, residing at ${d.accused_address}, hereby issue this Reply to your Notice dated ${formatDraftDate(d.notice_date)} as under:

1. At the outset, I deny each and every allegation, averment, and statement made in your notice, except those which are specifically admitted herein. The same are denied, both in law and on facts.

2. DENIAL OF LIABILITY: The contents of your notice are false, frivolous, vexatious, and devoid of any legal merit. The notice has been issued with the malafide intention of harassing and extorting money from me.

3. DEFENCE GROUND - ${d.defence_ground.toUpperCase()}:
${d.defence_details}${caseCite}

4. LEGAL POSITION: The cheque in question (No. ${d.cheque_number} for Rs.${Number(d.cheque_amount).toLocaleString('en-IN')}/-) was NOT issued in discharge of any legally enforceable debt or liability as alleged. The fundamental ingredients required under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 are not fulfilled in the present case.

5. That your notice is, therefore, legally untenable, misconceived, and not maintainable in law. Any action initiated on the basis of your illegal and frivolous notice shall be resisted by me with full force and at your cost and risk.

6. You are hereby put on notice that if you proceed with any criminal complaint or civil action, I shall be compelled to take appropriate legal action for malicious prosecution, defamation, and seek damages accordingly.

Sri Mohan).

4. ISSUANCE OF CHEQUE:
   That in discharge of the aforesaid legally enforceable debt/liability, the Accused issued Cheque No. ${d.cheque_number} dated ${formatDraftDate(d.cheque_date)} for an amount of Rs.${Number(d.cheque_amount).toLocaleString('en-IN')}/- (Rupees ${numberToWords(d.cheque_amount)} Only) drawn on ${d.bank_name}${d.branch_name ?

6. LEGAL DEMAND NOTICE:
   That as required under Section 138 of the NI Act, the Complainant sent a Legal Demand Notice to the Accused on ${formatDraftDate(d.notice_date)} by way of ${d.notice_mode}.

7. FAILURE TO PAY & CAUSE OF ACTION:
   That despite receipt of the said notice, the Accused has ${d.payment_made}. The 15-day statutory payment window has elapsed. The cause of action arose on the 16th day after service in strict compliance with Section 9 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 and Yogendra Pratap Singh vs. Savitri Pandey (2014) 10 SCC 713.

8. LIMITATION:
   The complaint is instituted within 30 days of the cause of action arising, strictly within the statutory limitation period under Section 142(1)(b) of the NI Act.

10. TERRITORIAL JURISDICTION (SECTION 142(2)(a) NI ACT):
    That this Hon'ble Court has exclusive territorial jurisdiction to entertain and try the present complaint as the cheque was presented for encashment at ${d.bank_name}${d.branch_name ? ' (' + d.branch_name + ' Branch)' : ''}, where the Complainant maintains an account, strictly in accordance with Section 142(2)(a) (as amended by NI Amendment Act, 2015) and Bridgestone India Pvt.

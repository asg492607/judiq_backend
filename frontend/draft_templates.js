I, ${d.accused_name}, residing at ${d.accused_address}, hereby issue this Reply to your Notice dated ${formatDraftDate(d.notice_date)} as under:

1. At the outset, I deny each and every allegation, averment, and statement made in your notice, except those which are specifically admitted herein. The same are denied, both in law and on facts.

2. DENIAL OF LIABILITY: The contents of your notice are false, frivolous, vexatious, and devoid of any legal merit. The notice has been issued with the malafide intention of harassing and extorting money from me.

The fundamental ingredients required under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 are not fulfilled in the present case.
